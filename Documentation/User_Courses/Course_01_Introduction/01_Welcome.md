## Video Script

[00:00 - 00:30] Opening

Hello and welcome to HelixCode! I'm excited to guide you through this comprehensive course on one of the most powerful AI-powered development tools available today. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to supercharge your workflow, or someone curious about how AI can transform software development, you're in the right place.

[00:30 - 01:15] What You'll Learn

In this course series, we'll take you from complete beginner to advanced HelixCode user. We've structured this learning journey into eight comprehensive courses, each building on the previous one. By the end, you'll be able to leverage HelixCode to build complete applications, manage distributed development teams, and integrate multiple AI providers into your workflow.

This first course focuses on introducing you to HelixCode - understanding what it is, how it's architected, and the philosophy behind its design. We'll keep things high-level here, setting the foundation for the hands-on work that comes in later courses.

[01:15 - 02:00] Course Structure Overview

Let me give you a quick overview of what's coming:

**Course 1 - Introduction** (that's this one!) covers the fundamentals and philosophy of HelixCode. We'll explore what makes it unique and how it fits into the modern development ecosystem.

**Course 2 - Installation** walks you through getting HelixCode set up on your system, from system requirements to configuration and your first successful run.

**Course 3 - Basic Usage** introduces you to the CLI interface, project creation, and basic workflows. This is where you'll start actually using HelixCode for real tasks.

**Course 4 - AI Providers** dives deep into the 14+ AI providers supported by HelixCode. You'll learn how to configure each one, optimize costs, and choose the right provider for each task.

[02:00 - 03:00] Advanced Courses

**Course 5 - Core Tools** explores the powerful tool system that makes HelixCode so capable. From filesystem operations to web browsing, shell access, and voice interactions, you'll master the entire toolkit.

**Course 6 - Advanced Workflows** takes you beyond the basics. You'll learn about plan mode, multi-file editing, auto-commit features, and snapshot management. This is where productivity really accelerates.

**Course 7 - Distributed Development** shows you how to scale HelixCode across teams and infrastructure. We'll cover SSH workers, load balancing, and enterprise deployment patterns.

**Course 8 - Real World Projects** is our capstone course where you'll build three complete applications from scratch using everything you've learned. This is where theory meets practice.

[03:00 - 03:45] Prerequisites and Requirements

Now, let's talk about prerequisites. HelixCode is designed to be accessible to developers of all skill levels, but some basic familiarity with command-line interfaces will be helpful. You don't need to be an expert - if you can navigate directories and run commands in a terminal, you're ready to start.

For the programming exercises, we'll be working with various languages including Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Don't worry if you're not expert in all of these - we'll explain the code as we go, and the focus is on using HelixCode effectively, not on language mastery.

[03:45 - 04:30] Learning Approach

Throughout these courses, we'll follow a practical, hands-on approach. Each chapter includes:

- Clear explanations of concepts
- Live demonstrations
- Code examples you can try yourself
- Exercises to reinforce your learning
- Real-world scenarios and use cases

I encourage you to follow along with the examples on your own system. Pause the videos, experiment with the commands, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. That's how we learn best.

[04:30 - 05:00] Getting Help and Community

Before we dive into the technical content, remember that you're not alone on this journey. HelixCode has comprehensive documentation, an active community, and multiple support channels. Throughout the courses, we'll point you to these resources.

If you get stuck, don't hesitate to refer back to earlier chapters, check the documentation, or reach out to the community. The HelixCode project is open source, and the community is welcoming and helpful.

Alright, let's get started! In the next chapter, we'll explore what HelixCode actually is, its history, and why it represents a significant evolution in how we think about AI-assisted development.
