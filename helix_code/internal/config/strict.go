// Strict config-key checking.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// Viper is permissive by default: v.Unmarshal() silently discards any key in
// the YAML that has no matching `mapstructure` tag on the target struct. A key
// nobody reads therefore *looks* like configuration — it sits in the file, it
// is documented by its own presence, an operator edits it and reasonably
// believes they changed the program's behaviour. Nothing tells them otherwise.
//
// The concrete defect that motivated this: `llm.timeout` and `llm.max_retries`
// were declared in config/config.yaml but absent from LLMConfig. An operator
// setting `llm.timeout: 30` configured nothing at all — a false belief about
// behaviour under load, held silently. `redis.db` was the same class of
// mistake in miniature: the struct tag is `database`, so the shipped `db: 0`
// was discarded and only the default survived.
//
// checkUnknownKeys turns that silent discard into a startup error naming the
// offending key and the section it sits in. A typo (`llm.temperture`) now
// fails fast instead of silently reverting to a default.
//
// Mechanism choice: explicit key diff, not mapstructure's ErrorUnused
// ------------------------------------------------------------------
// mapstructure's DecoderConfig.ErrorUnused would also reject unknown keys, and
// is a one-line change. It was rejected for three reasons:
//
//  1. WRONG INPUT SET. Viper's Unmarshal decodes v.AllSettings(), which is the
//     merge of the config file, every SetDefault in setDefaultsOn, and every
//     BindEnv key whose variable happens to be set. ErrorUnused cannot tell
//     those apart, so a stray default or an env binding would be reported as
//     if the operator had put it in their file. The thing we actually want to
//     police is the *file*, so this code reads the file — and only the file —
//     through a bare viper instance carrying no defaults and no env bindings.
//
//  2. WORSE MESSAGE. ErrorUnused reports the leaf paths it could not place.
//     For a dead block like `llm.providers` (13 providers × ~6 keys) that is
//     ~60 lines of noise for one mistake. checkUnknownKeys collapses each
//     unknown key to its SHALLOWEST unknown prefix, so that block is reported
//     once, as `llm.providers`, alongside the section it belongs to.
//
//  3. NO MAP ESCAPE HATCH NEEDED. Config legitimately contains open-ended
//     map fields (verifier.providers is a map[string]VerifierProviderConfig),
//     where arbitrary sub-keys are correct. Walking the struct ourselves lets
//     us mark those subtrees as wildcards deliberately, rather than relying on
//     mapstructure's decode-order behaviour to be permissive in the right
//     places.
//
// The check is deliberately confined to unknown *keys*. It says nothing about
// whether a known key's value is sensible; validateConfig still owns that.

// keyKind classifies a dotted config path derived from the Config struct.

// inertConfigKeys is the hand-maintained register of config keys that appear
// in shipped config files but that NO code path applies. Each is tolerated by
// the strict check — the loader will not refuse to start over them — but each
// produces a warning on every load saying, in as many words, that setting it
// changes nothing.
//
// Why tolerate rather than delete: these are pre-existing blocks, some of them
// large, and deleting configuration whose history has not been established is
// exactly the move §11.4.124 forbids. Warning is strictly better than today's
// silence and does not destroy anything. Deleting a block, or wiring it up, is
// a separate decision with a separate change.
//
// Why warn rather than ignore: an entry here is a key an operator can still
// write and still believe in. The register makes the lie visible at startup
// instead of hiding it in a struct definition nobody reads.
//
// TWO CATEGORIES live here, and the distinction matters:
//
//   - NOT DECLARED at all — the Config struct has no field for them, so
//     unknownKeys() flags them and this register is what downgrades the error
//     to a warning.
//   - DECLARED BUT UNCONSUMED — the struct has the field and the value loads
//     fine, but nothing reads it. unknownKeys() cannot see this class; it is
//     recorded here by hand.
//
// Removing an entry is the LAST step of fixing it: delete the line in the same
// change that either wires the key to a consumer or removes the key from the
// config files. An entry removed on its own turns the warning back into
// silence, which is the defect this whole file exists to prevent.
