# 06 — Agent-lane footprint measurements (OPEN-24)

**Measurement pass, not a research pass.** Every figure below was produced by
running the weights on this host on 2026-09-03 and reading a number off the
running process. Nothing here is extrapolated from a published figure, and where
a figure could not be produced this file says so instead of supplying one.

This file exists because `internal/catalogue/data/text.yaml`'s invariant 3
(UNVERIFIED FIGURES ARE NEVER RESOLVED INTO A CONFIDENT NUMBER) is what blocked
the agent lane's three configured candidates from ever being catalogued, and
SELF-7 records what happened the last time a footprint was guessed instead.

---

## What OPEN-24 actually is, reproduced

The agent lane (`cmd/agentgen-boot`, `family = catalogue.FamilyText`) selects
*within* the catalogue and never names a model. Its three former configured
candidates — Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407, GLM-4.7-Flash, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite —
are absent from the catalogue, so an operator holding working weights is refused.
Reproduced verbatim on the shipped binary, before any change:

```
$ go run ./cmd/agentgen-boot plan --pin mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m
DECLARED-USAGE: commercial (default — the narrowest purpose; …)
PIN: mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m — a constraint on the choice, not a bypass: …
MEASURED host=anton cpu=16 memory_available=12119MiB storage_available=1119753MiB accelerators=1 (measured)
WITHHELD mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m: unsupported_configuration — this host provides no
  catalogue-entry (mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m); more memory does not help; remedy=different-approach
CANNOT-CHOOSE: no text model can run on this measured host.
  what the candidates lacked: catalogue-entry
exit status 22
```

`more memory does not help; remedy=different-approach` is the narrowing: the
refusal is not "your host is too small", it is "no such model exists here".

---

## Host the measurements were taken on

```
$ grep -E 'MemTotal|MemAvailable|SwapFree' /proc/meminfo     # at measurement start
MemTotal:       31717560 kB          #  30.2 GiB
MemAvailable:   12570320 kB          #  11.99 GiB
SwapFree:           1476 kB          #  swap is EXHAUSTED (8 GiB total, ~0 free)
```

```
$ /usr/bin/llama-server --version
version: 8681 (Debian)
$ /usr/bin/llama-server --list-devices
Available devices:                    # ← empty: this is the CPU-ONLY Debian build
$ nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060, 12288 MiB, 10183 MiB
```

An RTX 3060 is present and idle, and **the installed llama.cpp cannot use it.**
Every figure below is therefore a **CPU / host-RAM** figure. No GPU-path figure
was measured, and none is stated.

Weights live in `/home/milosvasic/models/`, which is outside every git
repository (`git rev-parse` there: `fatal: not a git repository`) — CONST-053.

---

## Feasibility, decided BEFORE downloading anything

Sizes come from the HuggingFace model API (`/api/models/<repo>/tree/main`),
which returns each file's byte size and its LFS `oid` (a sha256). That is the
same authoritative-source method `embedding.yaml` and `vector.yaml` already
record as `measured:huggingface-blob-api`, and it costs no RAM, so it was done
first rather than after a multi-GB download.

| model | Q4_K_M bytes | GiB | vs 11.99 GiB available | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 | 7 477 208 192 | 6.96 | 58 % | **measurable** |
| DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct | 10 364 416 768 | 9.65 | 80 % of RAM, before KV or repack | **not measurable here** |
| GLM-4.7-Flash | 18 312 339 808 | 17.06 | 142 % — exceeds total available | **not measurable here** |

The two refusals are not caution, they are arithmetic:

* **GLM-4.7-Flash** needs 17.06 GiB of weights against 11.99 GiB available with
  no swap. It cannot be resident. It also does not fit the 10 183 MiB idle
  RTX 3060, so a CUDA build landing would not change this verdict.
* **DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite** at 9.65 GiB leaves 2.3 GiB for a repack buffer that
  Mistral-Nemo measured at 4.89 GiB (below), plus KV and compute. Under mmap
  llama.cpp *would* still emit a token by demand-faulting pages — but the
  footprint you would then measure is however much page cache the kernel
  happened to allow, i.e. a property of this host's memory pressure and not of
  the model. Recording that as `memory_required_bytes` would be SELF-7 in a new
  costume: a number that looks measured and describes the wrong thing.

Disk was never the constraint — 1.1 TB free.

## Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 Q4_K_M — MEASURED

### Provenance of the file

| property | value |
|---|---|
| local path | `/home/milosvasic/models/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M.gguf` |
| size (`stat -c %s`) | `7477208192` |

```
$ sha256sum Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M.gguf
7c1a10d202d8788dbe5628dc962254d10654c853cae6aaeca0618f05490d4a46  Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

This is the first digest in this catalogue verified against bytes on disk rather
than left absent. `embedding.yaml` anticipated exactly this: *"Populate the
digest … at first authorized download."*

### It runs — real output, not a load test

```
$ llama-completion -m …Q4_K_M.gguf -c 4096 -n 16 -t 4 --no-warmup --temp 0 \
    -p "The capital of France is" < /dev/null
The capital of France is Paris. Paris is known for its iconic landmarks such as
exit_code=0
```

### Allocation accounting — the figures that are pressure-independent

`llama_memory_breakdown_print`, verbatim, at two contexts:

```
n_ctx=512
| memory breakdown [MiB] | total   free    self   model   context   compute    unaccounted |
|   - Host               |                 7479 =  7083 +      80 +     315                |
|   - CPU_REPACK         |                 5006 =  5006 +       0 +       0                |

n_ctx=4096
| memory breakdown [MiB] | total   free    self   model   context   compute    unaccounted |
|   - Host               |                 8037 =  7083 +     640 +     314                |
|   - CPU_REPACK         |                 5006 =  5006 +       0 +       0                |
```

Two runs, two contexts, and the components behave exactly as they should:

| component | n_ctx=512 | n_ctx=4096 | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `model` | 7083 MiB | 7083 MiB | identical — independent of context and of host pressure |
| `compute` | 315 MiB | 314 MiB | identical within rounding |
| `CPU_REPACK` | 5006 MiB | 5006 MiB | identical — a haswell-backend repack of the weights |
| `context` (KV) | 80 MiB | 640 MiB | **exactly 8× for 8× context** |

The KV axis is therefore **measured-linear**: `640 MiB / 4096 tokens =
0.15625 MiB/token = 163840 bytes per token`, confirmed across an 8× range
rather than assumed from one point.

### Why peak RSS is NOT used as the figure

Peak resident set was captured independently, by polling `VmHWM` in
`/proc/<pid>/status` every 0.5 s:

| run | n_ctx | MemAvailable at start | peak `VmHWM` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| generation | 512 | 9 849 416 kB | 9 722 760 kB = **9496 MiB** |
| generation | 4096 | 12 570 320 kB | 8 101 892 kB = **7912 MiB** |

The run with **more** context and **more** free memory peaked **1584 MiB
lower**. That is not noise to be averaged away — it is the signature of mmap:
weight pages are file-backed and clean, so how many stay resident is decided by
the kernel under prevailing pressure, not by the model. **Peak RSS is a property
of the host at that moment and cannot be an admission figure.** The allocation
accounting above is the quantity that reproduced identically, and it is the one
this measurement rests on.

### The figure recorded, and its honest boundary

* `storage_required_bytes` = **7 477 208 192** — MEASURED, byte-exact, twice
  (local `stat`, HF API), digest-verified.
* `memory_required_bytes` = **9 956 106 240** (9496 MiB) — the highest resident
  peak actually observed. Chosen over the 8037 MiB steady-state accounting
  because the load-time transient — when the mmap'd source tensors and the
  4.89 GiB repack destination are both live — genuinely reached it, and an
  admission figure has to survive the transient, not just the steady state.
* Chosen *under* the fully-accounted ceiling of 8037 + 5006 = **13 043 MiB**,
  which nothing observed ever reached, because `CPU_REPACK` substantially
  overlaps the mmap'd weights it replaces. Recording 13 043 MiB would withhold
  the model from hosts that demonstrably run it.
* **UNVERIFIED:** the true requirement lies somewhere in
  `[8037, 13043] MiB`; 9496 MiB is the measured evidence within that interval,
  not a proof of the endpoint. A host near the figure may thrash rather than
  fail — both runs above were slow for exactly that reason.

### The context claim, and why it is 4096 and not 131072

The model's architectural maximum is 131 072 tokens. Pairing that number with
this memory figure would be false: at the measured 163 840 B/token, a 131 072
context is **20 480 MiB of KV alone**, so the honest total there is ~29 GiB —
roughly three times the recorded figure, and beyond this host entirely.
The entry therefore records the context it was **measured at**, 4096, and states
the per-token KV cost so any other context is derivable by a stated rule instead
of implied by an unstated one.

### Throughput

Measured, and deliberately **not** promoted to
`expected_capability.throughput_tokens_per_second`:

```
n_ctx=512 : eval time = 14030.28 ms / 23 runs ( 610.01 ms per token, 1.64 tokens per second)
n_ctx=4096: eval time = 17242.55 ms / 15 runs (1149.50 ms per token, 0.87 tokens per second)
```

These are CPU-only, 4 threads, on a host whose swap is exhausted — a property of
this measurement rig, not a capability of the model. It is carried in
`annotations` with its conditions attached; the entry keeps the family's standing
`UNVERIFIED: no measured throughput figure` note, because no figure was measured
under conditions that would generalise.

---

## The two that could not be measured, and what each needs

Neither is deleted, guessed, nor derived. Both remain deferred, each with the
measurement it is waiting on — the discipline `text.yaml` already applies to 24
of its 30 researched models.

### GLM-4.7-Flash

Never researched: it appears in **no** `model_id` in `text.yaml`, deferred block
included. Established here, all from authoritative sources:

| property | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash`, licence `mit`, gated `false` |
| architecture (`config.json`) | `Glm4MoeLiteForCausalLM`, `model_type: glm4_moe_lite` — mixture-of-experts |
| | 47 layers, hidden 2048, 64 routed experts + 1 shared, 4 experts/token |
| `max_position_embeddings` | 202 752 |
| GGUF Q4_K_M | `unsloth/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF` @ `0d32489ecb9db6d2a4fc93bd27ef01519f95474d`, **18 312 339 808 B**, sha256 `29837ed2c0fc5f51981adf8ac8083fcf80743c598381f13e9f06cbad0498b174` |
| official ggml build | `ggml-org/GLM-4.7-Flash-GGUF` @ `7559e96b7e324ab405897dc2b91492b0f376ad4a`, `Q4_K` **18 244 193 920 B** |

**NEEDS: a measured in-use footprint on a host with ≥ 24 GiB of usable RAM, or
a GPU with ≥ 20 GiB.** 17.06 GiB of weights does not fit 11.99 GiB of RAM or a
12 GiB card.

Also note for whoever catalogues it: it is mixture-of-experts, and per
`text.yaml` invariant 1 that says **nothing** about streaming eligibility —
eligibility is roster membership by name and nothing else. `glm-4.6` is already
in the deferred block as an MoE resolving to not-eligible.

### DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct

Also never researched — absent from every `model_id` in `text.yaml`.

| property | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct`, licence `other`, gated `false` |
| GGUF Q4_K_M | `bartowski/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct-GGUF` @ `8f248fa2072348f77a8bc37754e470de1f61866e` |
| size | **10 364 416 768 B** |
| sha256 (HF LFS oid) | `603bd3f8a0281d16571da7c08bd661ee17ff0d1be6fcbd1b42242da257ef0bb8` — identical in `lmstudio-community/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct-GGUF` |

**NEEDS TWO THINGS, and the second is not a measurement:**

1. A measured in-use footprint on a host with ≥ 16 GiB usable RAM (9.65 GiB of
   weights plus a repack buffer of Mistral-Nemo's order plus KV). It is the one
   of the three that would fit the idle RTX 3060's 10 183 MiB if the CUDA build
   lands — as a GPU-path figure, which is a different axis from everything
   measured here.
2. **An enumerated licence.** HF reports `license: other` — the DeepSeek Model
   Licence, not an SPDX identifier. `Entry.Validate` refuses an entry with no
   `license_id` *and* refuses one with no `permitted` purpose, and the four
   Gemma models in the deferred block are blocked on precisely this: terms
   established but purposes not enumerated. Someone must read the licence and
   record which purposes it grants. **No figure can substitute for that**, so
   this model would stay deferred even with a footprint in hand.

---

## Cross-lane note (not fixed here — OPEN-25)

The agent lane sets `AcceleratorBound: true`, so `memory_required_bytes` is
checked against a *device* budget through `vrambroker` as well as against host
RAM. Every figure in this file is a **host-RAM, CPU-backend** measurement, and
`CPU_REPACK` — 4.89 GiB of it — is a CPU-backend artefact that has no meaning on
a GPU. Handing this figure to a VRAM broker is exactly the shape OPEN-25
describes. This measurement pass does not change that, and does not pretend the
figure is device-neutral: it is labelled CPU throughout.

---

## Proof the lane admits it

Same binary, same real host, catalogue swapped via `HELIXLLM_CATALOGUE_DIR`.
The refusal changes kind — which is precisely what OPEN-24 is:

```
# BEFORE — shipped catalogue
WITHHELD mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m: unsupported_configuration — this host provides no
  catalogue-entry (mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m); more memory does not help; remedy=different-approach
  what the candidates lacked: catalogue-entry

# AFTER — catalogue carrying the measured entry
WITHHELD mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m: insufficient_resources — memory short by 1822MiB
  (needs 9494MiB, 7671MiB available after 4646MiB held back to keep the host responsive);
  remedy=change-host-or-pick-smaller
  what the candidates lacked: memory
```

The operator is no longer told "no such model, try a different approach". They are
told their host is 1822 MiB short — an honest, actionable refusal against the
MEASURED figure (`needs 9494MiB` is this file's 9 956 106 240 B). This host cannot
run it; that was always true and is now said correctly.

That the entry reached the resource comparison at all is itself the proof that it
passed every non-resource gate — `supports()` and `excludedBy()` — since a failure
in either would have produced `unsupported_configuration` or
`excluded_by_usage_terms` instead.

### Offered, on a host that can run it

A fixture host (48 GiB RAM, 24 GiB card — the agent lane is `AcceleratorBound`, so
the card is checked too) against the real catalogue, with the §11.4.115 polarity
switch the repo already uses:

```
$ go test ./internal/selection/ -run TestAgentLaneAdmitsTheMeasuredMistralNemo -v
GREEN: OFFERED helixllm/fixture-open24-can-run-nemo/mistral-nemo-12b:q4_k_m
       memory=9494MiB storage=7130MiB source=https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF
--- PASS

$ RED_MODE=1 go test ./internal/selection/ -run TestAgentLaneAdmitsTheMeasuredMistralNemo -v
RED: mistral-nemo-12b is absent from the catalogue entirely; 4 text options offered
--- PASS
```

The GREEN assertion includes `Entry.ValidateForAcquisition()`, which every other
entry in this catalogue fails: it requires a complete integrity block, and this is
the first entry whose digest was verified against bytes on disk.

Regression check, same catalogue: `go test ./internal/catalogue/...` ok;
`go test ./internal/selection/` ok; `TestShippedCatalogueLoads` reports
`35 entries across 8 families, 30 carrying a source` (34/29 before).

---

## Appendix A — the entry, ready to apply

NOT APPLIED. `internal/catalogue/data/text.yaml` was fenced to a concurrent agent
for this round of work, so this entry is handed over rather than committed. It is
validated: it was inserted into a copy of the catalogue at the current committed
content of every data file, and produced the runs above.

Insert into `internal/catalogue/data/text.yaml` at the end of the `entries:` list,
immediately before the `# DEFERRED` header. Then delete the now-superseded
deferred record 18 (`mistral-nemo-12b`, ~line 1165), whose `NEEDS: a sourced
Q4_K_M weight-file size` this measurement answers.

It REPLACES the research pass's 7623566950 B, which was a published *VRAM* figure and understates the measured CPU footprint by 2.3 GiB — admitting this model to a host that then cannot run it is the exact failure this catalogue exists to prevent."
      - "MEASUREMENT IS CPU-PATH: the installed llama.cpp (Debian b8681) is a CPU-only build — `--list-devices` lists none — so no GPU-path figure was measured and none is stated. 4886 MiB of the figure is a `CPU_REPACK` buffer that is a CPU-backend artefact with no meaning on a device."
      - "UNVERIFIED: the true requirement lies in [8037, 13043] MiB — llama.cpp's steady-state Host accounting at this context vs. its fully-accounted ceiling including CPU_REPACK. 9496 MiB is the measured evidence inside that interval, not a proof of its endpoint. Peak RSS under mmap is host-pressure dependent (a 4096-context run on a less-loaded host peaked 1584 MiB LOWER than a 512-context run), which is why the recorded figure is an observed peak and not an average."
      - "CONTEXT IS THE MEASURED ONE, 4096 — NOT the model's 131072 architectural maximum.

A 131072 context is therefore 20480 MiB of KV alone, ~29 GiB in total; pairing that context with this memory figure would be false."
      - "UNVERIFIED: no generalisable throughput figure. 1.64 tok/s (n_ctx=512) and 0.87 tok/s (n_ctx=4096) were measured, but CPU-only on 4 threads with host swap exhausted — a property of the measurement rig, not of the model.

### Why the deferred block cannot simply be uncommented

The deferred records are in an older shape than the live entries, and the loader is
strict (`KnownFields(true)`), so ONE unknown key refuses the WHOLE catalogue —
all 34 entries across all six files. Uncommenting record 18 as written would fail on
every one of: `description:`, `weight_source:` (the live key is `source:`),
a top-level `catalogue_status:` (lives under `annotations`), a per-entry
`streaming_roster:` map (entries may carry only a `streaming_family:` string —
an entry may never assert its own listedness), and `integrity.digest_key`
(lives under `annotations`). It also carries no `family:` key and a
`storage_required_bytes: null`, which decodes silently to 0 and is then refused
by `Entry.Validate`. The entry above is written in the live shape.

## Appendix B — the admission test, ready to apply

NOT APPLIED, because it fails until Appendix A lands. Add as
`internal/selection/open24_agent_lane_admission_test.go`; in RED_MODE it reads a
pre-change copy of the catalogue, so point `dir` at wherever that is kept.

```go
package selection_test

// OPEN-24: the agent lane's configured candidates were absent from the
// catalogue, so an operator holding working weights was REFUSED rather than
// served — a real narrowing (§11.4.122), not a tidy-up.
//
// POLARITY SWITCH (§11.4.115) — one source, two roles:
//
//	RED_MODE=1     — reproduction against the PRE-CHANGE catalogue: the model
//	                 is withheld for RequirementCatalogueEntry ("more memory
//	                 does not help"). This is the defect, present.
//	RED_MODE unset/0 (DEFAULT) — standing guard against the catalogue carrying
//	                 the MEASURED entry: the same model on the same fixture
//	                 host is OFFERED.
//
// The host is a fixture, and deliberately so: this asserts the ADMISSION
// decision, which is a property of the catalogue and the selection rules. The
// footprint the rules are fed is not a fixture — it was measured by running
// the weights (research/06-agent-lane-footprint-measurements.md).
