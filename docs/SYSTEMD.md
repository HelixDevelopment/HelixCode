# Helix Platform — systemd Boot Integration

**Revision:** 3
**Last modified:** 2026-08-06
**Maintainer:** HelixCode platform

The whole Helix platform — HelixCode, HelixAgent, HelixLLM and their
infrastructure — is installed as systemd **user** units that start on host boot
and survive restarts.

---

## Quick reference

```bash
./setup.sh                                  # install everything (units included)
./setup.sh --start                          # ... and start it now

systemctl --user start   helix.target       # bring the whole platform up
systemctl --user stop    helix.target       # bring it all down
systemctl --user status  helixagent         # one service
systemctl --user list-units 'helix*'        # all of them
journalctl --user -u helixagent -f          # follow one service's logs

scripts/install_systemd_units.sh            # re-install after editing a unit
scripts/install_systemd_units.sh --start    # install + enable + start
scripts/install_systemd_units.sh --uninstall

# Operator wrapper (recommended)
scripts/helixctl.sh install                 # build + install + start
scripts/helixctl.sh start|stop|restart
scripts/helixctl.sh status [unit]
scripts/helixctl.sh enable|disable
scripts/helixctl.sh validate                # run platform readiness probe
scripts/helixctl.sh logs <unit>
```

The `helixctl.sh` wrapper is the single operator entry point: every action is
implemented through `systemctl --user`, so the whole platform is controlled via
systemd user-space. `validate` runs `scripts/validate-helix-platform.sh`, which
probes every unit and every exposed port and writes a timestamped report under
`qa-results/helix-platform-validation/`.

Prove the platform is actually *serving*, not merely `active` (§11.4.108):

```bash
curl -s      http://localhost:8100/api/scores        # llmsverifier
curl -sk     https://localhost:8443/internal/health  # helixllm-gateway (TLS)
curl -s      http://localhost:7061/health            # helixagent
curl -s      http://localhost:8081/health            # helixcode-server
```

---

## Units

`helix.target` is the umbrella; each service declares `WantedBy=helix.target`,
so enabling a service wires it in automatically.

| Unit | Type | Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `helix.target` | target | — | Umbrella — start/stop the platform as one |
| `helixcode-infra.service` | oneshot | see below | 11 containers via podman compose — Postgres, Redis, memcached, Ollama, Selenium, chromedp, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Qdrant, Cognee, plus a `multicast-router` sidecar that publishes no host port |
| `llmsverifier.service` | simple | 8100 | LLMsVerifier — model/provider verification + scoring API |
| `helixllm-coder.service` | oneshot | 18434 | Local Qwen3-Coder-30B model container |
| `helixllm-gateway.service` | simple | 8443 (TLS) | HelixLLM multi-provider LLM router |
| `helixagent.service` | simple | 7061 | HelixAgent runtime (HTTP/1.1+2 on TCP, HTTP/3 on UDP) |
| `helixcode-server.service` | simple | 8081 | HelixCode API server |

Start ordering: `infra` → `llmsverifier` → `llm-coder` / `llm-gateway` →
`helixagent` → `helixcode-server`.

Dependency strength is deliberate per service:

- `helixagent` uses `Requires=helixcode-infra.service` — its startup dependency
  verification is mandatory and hard-fails, so starting without infra is
  pointless.
- `helixllm-gateway` uses `Wants=llmsverifier.service` — the gateway polls
  `{verifier}/api/scores` and falls back to a static score table when it is
  unreachable. That fallback is a real working mode, so a down verifier must
  not prevent the gateway from starting and routing.
- `helixcode-server` uses `Wants=` for the same reason: it has its own
  infra-boot fallback path.

**Live state captured 2026-07-28** — a point-in-time observation, not a standing
guarantee; re-probe before relying on it. All six units `active`, `enabled`,
`NRestarts=0`; 14 containers running on the host, 11 healthy, 0 unhealthy; each
of the four HTTP health routes in the Quick reference returned `200`.

**Full stop/start cycle executed 2026-08-06** (evidence:
`docs/qa/live_systemd_boot_20260806T145857Z/`) — the first pass in which the
platform was actually torn down and cold-booted rather than observed running.
Teardown was clean (all six `inactive`, none `failed`, 0 containers, all 18
documented ports closed). The cold boot converged to all six `active`, 12
containers, all 18 ports open, and all four health routes `200` — but **not
cleanly**, and the two headline results below are only visible on a cold boot:

- `helixagent` **hard-failed once and finished with `NRestarts=1`** — the Cognee
  readiness race, now tracked as HXC-228 (see *Gotchas*).
- `helixllm-gateway` took **37 minutes** (22:24:54→23:01:52) from `ExecStart` to
  `server listening addr=0.0.0.0:8443`, reporting `active (running)` throughout —
  tracked as HXC-231.

A boot that is judged only after it has settled looks perfect; both defects are
invisible unless the boot itself is watched.

### Port map

| Port | Service | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 8081 | helixcode-server | `config/replica-8081.yaml` |
| 8443 | helixllm-gateway | **TLS** — use `https://`. Health route is `/internal/health` (registered in `submodules/helix_llm/internal/server/server.go:167`). *Not* `/v1/models` — that is the path the gateway uses to probe **downstream** providers, and it answers `{"object":"list","data":null}` until provider keys are configured, so it is a misleading health signal |
| 7061 | helixagent | TCP *and* UDP (QUIC) |
| 8100 | llmsverifier | the address the gateway looks for; the binary's own default is 8080, so the unit passes `--port 8100` explicitly |
| 18434 | helixllm-coder | local model |
| 5433 | infra postgres | not 5432 — 5432 belongs to an unrelated stack on this host |
| 6380 | infra redis | not 6379, same reason |
| 8083 | infra weaviate | HTTP; moved off 8081, which helixcode-server owns |
| 50051 | infra weaviate | gRPC |
| 8082 | infra chromadb | |
| 8000 | infra cognee | |
| 6333/6334 | infra qdrant | |
| 11434 | infra ollama | |
| 11211 | infra memcached | |
| 4444/7900 | infra selenium | |
| 9222 | infra chromedp | |
| — | infra multicast-router | sidecar; container-network only, publishes no host port |

---

## Boot chain

These are **user** units, not system units, because the services run rootless
podman (§11.4.161) as the invoking user and read that user's `~/.config/cdi`
GPU specs.

Boot therefore depends on three links, **all** of which must hold:

```
loginctl Linger=yes                        # user manager runs without a login
  └─ default.target.wants/helix.target     # helix.target enabled
       └─ helix.target.wants/*.service     # each service enabled
```

1. **Linger.** User units normally start at *login*. `loginctl enable-linger
   $USER` is what makes them start at *boot* instead — the installer enables it
   and reports whether it succeeded. Without linger the platform only comes up
   once someone logs in. This is the link most often missing.
2. **`helix.target` enabled.** The target declares `WantedBy=default.target`,
   so enabling it creates the `default.target.wants/helix.target` symlink that
   pulls the platform in at boot.
3. **Each service enabled.** Every service declares `WantedBy=helix.target`, so
   `systemctl --user enable <unit>` creates the `helix.target.wants/<unit>`
   symlink. The target file itself enumerates no members — it is populated
   purely by these symlinks, which is why adding or removing a service never
   requires editing the target.

### Enable / disable

```bash
# enable everything (what the installer does)
systemctl --user enable helix.target
systemctl --user enable helixcode-infra helixllm-coder helixllm-gateway \
                        llmsverifier helixagent helixcode-server
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"

# disable one service — removes only its helix.target.wants/ symlink
systemctl --user disable helixcode-server

# stop the platform coming up at boot, leaving the units installed
systemctl --user disable helix.target
```

`enable` only wires a unit into the boot graph; it does not start it. Add
`--now`, or `systemctl --user start helix.target`, to do both.

Verify all three links:

```bash
loginctl show-user "$USER" -p Linger             # expect Linger=yes
ls ~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants/  # expect helix.target
ls ~/.config/systemd/user/helix.target.wants/    # expect the six services
systemctl --user is-enabled helix.target helixagent
```

---

## Unit templating

The units in `scripts/systemd/` are **templates** containing `@HELIX_ROOT@` and
`@HELIXLLM_BIN@`. `scripts/install_systemd_units.sh` expands them for the
current checkout when installing into `~/.config/systemd/user/`.

Never hand-edit the installed copies — edit the template in `scripts/systemd/`
and re-run the installer, otherwise the change is lost on the next install and
a fresh clone cannot reproduce it. The installer refuses to install a unit that
still contains an unexpanded placeholder.

---

## Secrets

`helixagent` needs `DB_PASSWORD` and `JWT_SECRET`; both are read from `.env`
via `EnvironmentFile=` and are **never** inlined into unit files, which are
world-readable and version-controlled (CONST-042 / §12.1). `.env` is mode 0600
and gitignored.

If `.env` is missing, `EnvironmentFile=-` (leading `-`) makes it optional, so
the service fails with a clear dependency error rather than a unit-file parse
error.

---

## Gotchas

### A unit env var the binary never reads fails **silently**

These binaries are env-configured through `envconfig` struct tags, not through
a config flag. If a unit sets a variable name the struct does not declare, the
setting is simply **inert** — no parse error, no warning, no failed unit. The
service starts, reports `active (running)`, and quietly runs on the compiled-in
default. This is the worst failure shape in the whole file: everything is green
and the intent never took effect.

Two instances of this class, both found and fixed on 2026-07-28 in
`helixllm-gateway.service`:

| Unit set | Binary actually reads | Consequence of the mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| `HELIX_CACHE_REDIS_HOST` / `HELIX_CACHE_REDIS_PORT` | `HELIX_REDIS_HOST` / `HELIX_REDIS_PORT` (`config.go:121-122`, port default `6379`) | Redis fell back to `:6379`, where nothing listens |
| *(unset)* | `HELIX_MODELS_DIR` (`config.go:70`, default `/models`) | Default is a **container** path; running natively, every model auto-download failed |

Symptoms the gateway logged on every start, before the fix:

```
dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6379: connect: connection refused
KV cache: Redis unreachable, falling back to in-memory
downloader: create models dir /models: mkdir /models: permission denied
```

Note that both fell back to a *working degraded mode* — in-memory cache, no
downloads — which is precisely why they survived unnoticed.

**Rule: when adding or changing an `Environment=` line, diff the name against
the binary's actual env tags. Never infer the name from the config *key*.**

```bash
# every env var the binary really reads
grep -rn 'env:"' submodules/helix_llm/internal/shared/config/config.go

# every env var the unit sets
grep -o 'Environment=[A-Z_]*' scripts/systemd/helixllm-gateway.service
```

Compiled-in defaults aimed at a container (`/models`, `:5432`, `:6379`,
`:8001`) are a recurring source of this: they are plausible, they are wrong for
a native user service, and they never announce themselves.

### `active` does not mean *listening* — the gateway proves it

`helixllm-gateway` downloads models **before** it binds its listener. Between
`ExecStart` and the first accepted connection the unit is already
`active (running)` while `:8443` refuses connections. On a first boot after a
model-cache wipe that window is **several minutes** long.

**Measured 2026-08-06: 37 minutes** — `ExecStart` 22:24:54, `server listening`
23:01:52. A `curl` at 22:55 returned `HTTP 000` (connection refused) while
`systemctl` reported `active (running)` and `ss -ltn` showed nothing on 8443.
The window is bounded by an *external* dependency (HuggingFace download speed),
not by anything local: on that run the second model aborted after ~30 minutes
with `context deadline exceeded`, and had the site been unreachable the gateway
would arguably never have bound at all. Tracked as HXC-231.

So a green `systemctl --user status` during that window is accurate and
useless. Probe the port, not the unit state (§11.4.108):

```bash
curl -sk https://localhost:8443/internal/health   # the real readiness signal
journalctl --user -u helixllm-gateway -f          # watch the download progress
```

Raising `TimeoutStartSec` does not help here: the unit is `Type=simple`, so
systemd considers it started the moment the process forks — it is not waiting
on readiness at all.

### Every cold boot fails `helixagent` once — the infra oneshot lies about readiness

`helixcode-infra` is `Type=oneshot` running `podman compose up -d`, which returns
when the containers have been **created**, not when they are **serving**.
`helixagent` declares `Requires=`/`After=helixcode-infra.service`, so systemd
considers the dependency satisfied and starts it seconds later — into a window
where Cognee's port is already forwarded by `rootlessport` but the app behind it
is not yet accepting. HelixAgent's dependency check is strict and fatal, so it
exits 1:

```
❌ DEPENDENCY FAILED  dependency=Cognee
   error="... read tcp 127.0.0.1:43606->127.0.0.1:8000: read: connection reset by peer"
level=fatal msg="Application failed" ... BOOT BLOCKED: 1 of 4 mandatory dependencies failed
helixagent.service: Failed with result 'exit-code'.
```

`Restart=` recovers it ~16 s later and the retry passes all four checks, so the
settled state looks perfect. Reproduced identically on 2026-07-27 and on the
2026-08-06 cold boot. The tell is `NRestarts=1`:

```bash
systemctl --user show helixagent -p NRestarts   # expect 0; a cold boot gives 1
```

This self-heals *by luck* — it depends on Cognee winning a race against the
restart budget. Tracked as HXC-228; the fix is for the infra unit to wait for
container health rather than for `compose up` to return.

### `systemctl stop helix.target` returns long before the platform is down

All six services declare `PartOf=helix.target`, so stopping the target genuinely
does propagate — the doc's "bring it all down" is correct in outcome. But the
propagated stops are **separate jobs that `systemctl` does not wait for**. On
2026-08-06 `systemctl --user stop helix.target` returned `exit 0` in **11 ms**
while `helixllm-coder` and `helixllm-gateway` were still `deactivating` and 7
containers were still running; full quiescence took up to ~2 minutes.

Do not treat the command's exit as teardown-complete — poll for it:

```bash
systemctl --user stop helix.target
until [ "$(podman ps -q | wc -l)" -eq 0 ] \
      && ! systemctl --user is-active --quiet helixagent; do sleep 1; done
```

### `podman ps` is not a reachability oracle

`helixcode-infra.service` sets `KillMode=process`. `podman compose up -d`
returns immediately but leaves `conmon` and `rootlessport` (the host-side port
forwarders) in the unit's cgroup. Under the default
`KillMode=control-group`, any stop *or failure* makes systemd SIGKILL the whole
cgroup — killing the port forwarders of every container in the stack while the
containers themselves survive.

When that happens `podman ps` still reports `Up (healthy)
0.0.0.0:5433->5432/tcp`, because the container is alive; only the forwarder is
gone. Nothing on the host can connect.

**Always confirm reachability with `ss -ltn` or `curl`, never with `podman ps`.**

```bash
# what is ACTUALLY reachable
for p in 5433 6380 8083 8082 8000 6333 11434; do
  ss -ltn | grep -q ":$p " && echo "ok $p" || echo "DEAD $p"
done
```

### `helixagent` serves HTTP/3, so it binds UDP too

`ss -ltn` (TCP only) will not show the QUIC listener. Use `ss -ltn` *and*
`ss -lun`, or `ss -an | grep 7061`.

---

## Troubleshooting

```bash
systemctl --user status <unit> -l          # why it failed
journalctl --user -u <unit> -n 50          # recent log
journalctl --user -u <unit> --since today  # today's log
systemctl --user reset-failed              # clear failed state before retrying
systemctl --user cat <unit>                # the installed (expanded) unit
```

**A unit is `active (running)` but nothing is listening.** Unit state is not
proof the service works (§11.4.108). Check the journal for where startup
stalled, and probe the port directly. For `helixllm-gateway` this is expected
behaviour during model download, not a fault — see *Gotchas*.

**Infra fails with `address already in use`.** Something else on the host holds
the port. Identify the owner *before* acting — it may belong to another project
(§11.4.174):

```bash
ss -ltnp | grep ':<port>'
```

---

## Known gaps

Recorded honestly rather than papered over (§11.4.6):

- **`distributed_locks` and `agent_instances` tables have no schema.** HelixAgent
  references `distributed_locks` from three Go files but no migration or `.sql`
  file defines it, so it logs `Error cleaning locks: ERROR: relation
  "distributed_locks" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42P01)` every 60 s.
  **Re-verified 2026-08-06 directly against the databases rather than only from
  the log** — neither table exists in *any* of the three (`postgres`,
  `helixcode_test`, `helixagent_db`):

  ```bash
  for db in postgres helixcode_test helixagent_db; do
    podman exec helixcode-infra-postgres psql -U helixcode -d "$db" \
      -tAc "select to_regclass('public.distributed_locks');"   # → empty in all three
  done
  ```

  Rate is exactly 60 occurrences per 60 minutes. `agent_instances` is the same
  class, surfaced once during HelixAgent boot (`relation "agent_instances" does
  not exist`). Non-fatal — the service runs normally — but the locking feature
  these tables back is silently inert. Tracked as HXC-232. Still needs a
  migration authored by someone who can specify the intended columns; not
  invented here.
- **`helixllm-gateway` lists no models** — `GET /v1/models` returns
  `{"object":"list","data":null}` (re-confirmed 2026-08-06) until provider API
  keys are configured in `.env`. The API itself works; use `/internal/health`
  for readiness. Note this is now *doubly* explained: no provider keys **and**
  no local model server (next item).
- **`llama-server` is not installed on this host at all.** The gateway logs
  `Failed to start embedded llama-server ... executable file not found in $PATH`
  on every start. Verified 2026-08-06 that this is **not** a `PATH` problem —
  no file named `llama-server` exists anywhere under `/usr/local/bin`,
  `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `/opt` or `$HOME`. The gateway
  nevertheless spends the 37-minute download window fetching a model for it, so
  the downloaded `.gguf` sits on disk unusable. Tracked as HXC-233.
- **HelixAgent's MCP plug-in servers fail to build and never start.** On each
  boot HelixAgent runs `podman-compose ... docker-compose.mcp-servers.yml up -d`,
  which fails at `RUN pnpm install ... && pnpm -r run build` (and the
  `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` build) with `exit status 1`. HelixAgent
  downgrades this to `Failed to start some MCP servers (local mode)` and
  continues, so the platform looks healthy while every MCP-provided capability
  is absent. Observed twice in the 2026-08-06 boot; each attempt also re-pulls
  `node:22-bookworm-slim`, lengthening every startup. Tracked as HXC-234.
- **RAG silently degrades to a non-semantic embedder.** The gateway warns that
  `HELIX_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` is unset so it is using the `HashEmbedder`, which
  by its own warning text does "NOT capture semantic similarity". Retrieval
  keeps answering rather than failing, so degraded results are indistinguishable
  from good ones at the call site. Tracked as HXC-235.
- **The gateway runs Gin in `debug` mode** under systemd
  (`[WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.`).
  Tracked as HXC-229.
- **QUIC receive-buffer warning** from `helixllm-gateway`
  (`failed to sufficiently increase receive buffer size (was: 208 kiB, wanted:
  7168 kiB, got: 416 kiB)`) — a host sysctl tuning matter (`net.core.rmem_max`),
  not a service defect. Revision 2 recorded this as *not re-observed* and
  therefore unconfirmed; it **was re-observed on the 2026-08-06 boot**, so it is
  now confirmed present.

### Resolved since Revision 2

- **The gateway's tracked unit template has caught up with its installed copy.**
  Revision 2 recorded that the two `Environment=` fixes (`HELIX_REDIS_HOST`/
  `PORT`, `HELIX_MODELS_DIR`) were present only in the installed unit and would
  be silently reverted by the next `install_systemd_units.sh` run. **That gap is
  closed** — verified 2026-08-06 that the tracked template now carries all nine
  `Environment=` lines identically, including `HELIX_REDIS_PORT=6380` and
  `HELIX_MODELS_DIR=%h/models`, and that the inert `HELIX_CACHE_REDIS_*` names
  are gone. The remaining diff is comment wording only; the units are
  functionally identical, and all five other units are byte-identical:

  ```bash
  diff <(sed "s|@HELIX_ROOT@|$PWD|g; s|@HELIXLLM_BIN@|$HOME/.local/bin/helixllm|g" \
          scripts/systemd/helixllm-gateway.service | grep -vE '^\s*#|^\s*$') \
       <(grep -vE '^\s*#|^\s*$' ~/.config/systemd/user/helixllm-gateway.service)
  # → no output
  ```

  The `Environment=`-name-mismatch fixes described under *Gotchas* are therefore
  now reproducible from a fresh clone.
- **Redis reaches the gateway.** Following from the above, the 2026-08-06 boot
  logged `KV cache: Redis connected` rather than Revision 2's
  `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:6379: connect: connection refused` / `falling back to
  in-memory`. The `HELIX_REDIS_PORT=6380` fix is confirmed working at runtime.

### Resolved since Revision 1

- **LLMsVerifier now publishes real scores.** Revision 1 recorded
  `GET :8100/api/scores` returning `{"scores":{}}` ("nothing measured yet").
  As of 2026-07-28 it returns
  `{"scores":{"llamacpp":{"total":96,"model_count":1}}}` — the verifier seeds
  its providers from the consumer-owned `config/llmsverifier/config.yaml` and
  has published its first real aggregate, so the gateway can adopt it instead
  of its static fallback table. Coverage is one provider so far; the remaining
  providers stay unscored until a verification pass runs with their API keys
  configured.

## Sources verified 2026-08-06 (Revision 3)

PRIMARILY INTERNALLY DERIVED, as in Revision 2. What distinguishes this pass:
Revision 2 explicitly declined to execute any `systemctl` start/stop, so its
enable/disable and start-ordering claims were read from unit files rather than
observed. **Revision 3 executed a full stop/start cycle** and every claim added
above is from that captured run. Verified in this pass:

- **Target propagation, both directions**, by executing
  `systemctl --user start helix.target` (target went `inactive`→`active` with
  services already up) then `stop` (all six `PartOf=` members went `inactive`,
  0 containers, all 18 ports closed) then `start` again from cold.
- **`PartOf=helix.target` on all six services**, by `systemctl --user show -p
  PartOf` — this is what makes the documented "stop brings it all down" true,
  and `WantedBy=` alone would not.
- **The cold-boot `helixagent` failure**, from the boot-window journal
  (`--after-cursor`) showing the fatal Cognee check, the systemd restart, and
  the passing retry, corroborated by `NRestarts=1`.
- **The 37-minute gateway listener gap**, from its journal timestamps
  (`ExecStart` → `server listening`) cross-checked against a `curl` returning
  `HTTP 000` mid-window and `ss -ltn` showing 8443 closed at that moment.
- **The missing tables**, by `to_regclass()` against all three databases
  directly, not merely from the error text.
- **`llama-server` absence**, by `command -v` plus a bounded `find` over the
  unit's `PATH` directories and `$HOME`.
- **Template drift closure**, by expanding all six templates and diffing them
  against the installed copies.
- **Runtime serving**, by HTTP GETs to all four documented health routes plus
  `/v1/models` and `/v1/hardware`, a live `psql` query, a Redis
  `PING`/`SET`/`GET`/`DEL` round-trip, and six infra HTTP probes — all `200` or
  their protocol equivalent.

Honest boundary (§11.4.6 / §11.4.99(B)): (1) the upstream systemd manual pages
were again NOT re-fetched, so generic systemd semantics still carry no
external-currency claim — but the propagation and job-ordering behaviour
described above is now observed rather than inferred; (2) `enable`/`disable`
were still not exercised (the units were already enabled and deliberately left
that way), so those commands remain documented from `[Install]` sections;
(3) boot-at-host-boot via linger was not tested — that needs a host reboot,
which is forbidden under CONST-033 / §11.4.133, so the linger chain is verified
only as far as `Linger=yes` and the two symlink sets; (4) the three postgres
`FATAL: role/database does not exist` lines in the 2026-08-06 journal are the
verifying agent's own mis-typed `psql` probes at 23:26/23:37/23:47 local, not
platform defects, and are excluded from the findings above.

Evidence: `docs/qa/live_systemd_boot_20260806T145857Z/`.

systemd user-unit installation, so its authoritative sources are the tracked
unit definitions, the installer, and the consuming binaries' own configuration
code. Verified in this pass:

- **The six installed units** at `~/.config/systemd/user/` read directly:
  `helixcode-infra`, `llmsverifier`, `helixllm-coder`, `helixllm-gateway`,
  `helixagent`, `helixcode-server`. The `Requires=` / `Wants=` /
  `WantedBy=helix.target` claims above are quoted from those files.
- **The boot chain**, by listing `default.target.wants/` (contains
  `helix.target`), `helix.target.wants/` (contains all six services), and
  `loginctl show-user -p Linger` (`Linger=yes`).
- **Env-tag claims**, by `grep -n 'env:"'` over
  `submodules/helix_llm/internal/shared/config/config.go`: `HELIX_MODELS_DIR`
  default `/models` at line 70; `HELIX_REDIS_HOST` line 121; `HELIX_REDIS_PORT`
  default `6379` line 122. The `HELIX_CACHE_REDIS_*` names the template still
  sets appear nowhere in that file.
- **The gateway health route**, by locating its registration at
  `submodules/helix_llm/internal/server/server.go:167`
  (`s.engine.GET("/internal/health", …)`), and confirming `/v1/models` is the
  *downstream-provider* probe path (`internal/a2a/downstream.go:72`,
  `internal/mcpgateway/downstream.go:69`).
- **The port map**, against the `ports:` entries of
  `compose.helixcode-infra.yml` (including weaviate's second mapping `50051`,
  previously undocumented) and the 11 services it defines.
- **The template drift**, by expanding `scripts/systemd/helixllm-gateway.service`
  and diffing it against the installed copy.
- **Runtime state**, by read-only HTTP GETs (`/api/scores`,
  `/internal/health`, two `/health` routes — all `200`) and a read-only
  `journalctl --user` window for the `distributed_locks` gap.

Honest boundary (§11.4.6 / §11.4.99(B)) — three explicit gaps: (1) the upstream
systemd manual pages (`systemd.unit`, `systemd.service`, `systemd.target`,
`journalctl`) were NOT re-fetched in this pass, so the generic systemd
semantics described here rest on the in-repo unit files alone and carry no
external-currency claim; (2) no `systemctl` start/stop/restart/enable was
executed in this pass — the platform was already running and was deliberately
not mutated, because other work is live on this shared host (§11.4.174), so the
enable/disable commands above are documented from the units' `[Install]`
sections and the installer, not from an executed enable cycle; (3) the QUIC
receive-buffer warning is carried over from an earlier run and was not
re-observed, as flagged in *Known gaps*. Re-verify against the official systemd
documentation per the §11.4.99 180-day staleness window before this guide is
used as external-facing operator authority.
